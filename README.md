# README - 0 to PWA in Minutes

## Intro:

**0 to PWA in Minutes***

Quick introduction/refresher to converting an existing site/template to a Progressive Web App.

```Disclaimer: Mileage will vary depending on the number of times you trip. :)```

## Starter Template:

The template that I picked to convert to a Progressive Web App is called Goggles Ecommerce and it's created by w3layouts.

It's based on Bootstrap and it features many common features found among other ecommerce sites/templates.
